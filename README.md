# Unexpected 'this' Keyword Behavior in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript related to the unpredictable nature of the `this` keyword, especially in strict mode.

## The Problem

The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the current execution context.  However, this context can vary depending on how the function is called.  In non-strict mode, it might default to the global object (`window` in browsers), whereas in strict mode it's `undefined` in most cases.  This can lead to unexpected results and bugs.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file demonstrates how calling a function without explicitly setting the value of `this` can lead to an unexpected `this` value.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents two different solutions for fixing the behavior: 
1. Using `bind()` to explicitly set the `this` value. 
2. Using arrow functions which inherit the `this` value from the surrounding scope.  This is often a cleaner approach. 

This example highlights the importance of understanding `this` in JavaScript and how to use the `bind()` method or arrow functions to avoid common pitfalls.
